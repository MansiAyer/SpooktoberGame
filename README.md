# SpooktoberGame
*Trying to create an extremely simple, Spooktober-themed Metroidvania game in Unity*

Metroidvania is a subgenre of action-adventure video games. It features a large interconnected world map the player can explore, but access to parts of the world is limited by doors or other obstacles that can only be opened after the player has acquired special tools, weapons or abilities within the game.
The game I'm trying to create has an 'ol skeletal boi for MC, and is set in a graveyard. It has 2 time bound tasks, and a threat similar to Battle Royale's shrinking safe zone. It's played in first person.  I'm using Unity and C# to create it.
I'm quite a beginner, so I'm trying to make a really simple game to begin with. Might add more features as my skills progress. 


**Game Objective**

Skeletal needs to collect a minimum number of calcium capsules from the available capsules scattered around the graveyard. This allows skeletal to access the central tomb, inside which there is a trumpet. Skeletal must doot. These two tasks need to be done before the safe zone shrinks and skeletal gets preyed upon by ghouls.  Skeletal wins if it is able to doot in time. 

**Plan Changes**

#1 - Threat changed to ghouls wandering around the graveyard. Skeletal must avoid getting caught.
